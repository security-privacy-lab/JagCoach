# JagCoach
JagCoach is an in development pipeline for automated speech analysis.

We plan to offer a full system that ingests Student's speech videos and presentations, collects speech audio and video statistics, and provides the user natural sounding feedback.

As of 4/15/2024, we currently injest audio and return a summary based on a user's Pace, Tone, and Speech Clarity. In the future, we plan to fully flesh out the pipeline, analyzing more audio and video information, and provide better feedback to users, before making a full featured web interface for users to interact with.

The code in this repository currently represents a manually processed pipeline, and the code is subject to change.
