We measure three aspects of a speech: Rate/Speed, taken at Syllables per second, Fundamental frequency standard deviation, which measures how varied a person's speech emphasis/tone is, and Speech to overall noise ratio, which represents a percentage of how much of a speech's recording time consists of meaningful speech content. The average baseline is 4 syllables per second for Rate, 51.04hz for Fundamental frequency standard deviation, and 0.7 for the speech to noise ratio, and for all of these values, the higher the better, with reasonable limits of course. The student got {} syllables per second for Rate, {}hz for Fundamental frequency standard deviation and {} for the speech to noise ratio. While comparing the student to the baseline, make sure to use encouraging language to analyze the student on all three statistics while not mentioning any of the statistics directly, while also making sure to provide criticism if the baseline isn't met.
